<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:28px;">   
Hey! Nice to meet you!!</span>   

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">   
Hi, I'm Pavitra Prabhu, and I'm obsessed with data. I currently work as a **Senior Data Scientist** at **Intuit**, where I am part of a dynamic Data Science team. In my role, I specialize in architecting scalable data pipelines, performing advanced analytics, **machine learning**, and deriving actionable insights from complex datasets to inform product development, optimize operations, and support key business strategies.</span>   

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">   
Before Intuit, I worked at leading global organizations like [Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)](https://personal.rbs.co.uk), [Citizens Bank](https://www.citizensbank.com/HomePage.aspx), and [Société Générale](https://www.societegenerale.asia/en/), where I helped design and implement data-driven solutions to improve business outcomes. I have a strong track record of leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to build predictive models, optimize business processes, and provide valuable insights that drive decision-making.</span>   

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">   
I hold a Master’s degree in Finance Analysis from the [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu) and a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Visvesvaraya Technological University](https://vtu.ac.in), India. My career journey has allowed me to develop a solid foundation in data engineering, analytics, and financial technologies.</span>   

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">   
I am passionate about the intersection of technology and business, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn. I enjoy building reusable software tools using **Python**, **R**, and **VBA**, and I’m always open to collaborating, mentoring, or exploring new avenues in data science. Outside of work, I’m an avid traveler, photographer, and cooking enthusiast.</span>   

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">   
Feel free to explore my portfolio on this website, where I share insights from my personal projects, work, and the data science tools I’ve developed. Let’s connect—whether for collaboration or knowledge sharing—via email or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavitra-prabhu).</span>
