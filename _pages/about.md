Hey! Nice to meet you!!</span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">   
Hi, I'm Pavitra Prabhu, and I'm obsessed with data ; Previously worked in the field of data analytics for global investment banks and financial institutions, such as, [Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)](https://personal.rbs.co.uk), [Citizens Bank](https://www.citizensbank.com/HomePage.aspx) and [Société Générale](https://www.societegenerale.asia/en/).</span>
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">   
  I was born and brought up in the beautiful state of Karnataka, India. Obtained my Bachelor of Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Visvesvaraya Technological University](https://vtu.ac.in),India and my Masters in Finance Analysis from the [University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee](https://uwm.edu), United States.</span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">   
  One area that I’m passionate about is technology. I am so intrigued by its ability to solve interesting challenges in so many unique ways.  I’m always looking to challenge myself and learn new things. My personal interests include traveling and exploring new places and new cultures, photography, cooking and reading books.</span>   
  <span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px;">  
   This website is meant to be a portfolio of all of my side projects and some of my work and school projects. It'll also have a bunch of my notes and my adventures in the realm of data science. I enjoy writing useful & reusable software tools using Python,R and VBA;   
  I'm always open to messages. I'm open to mentor, or be mentored. You can email me, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavitra-prabhu), or send me a message using the form below.</span>
