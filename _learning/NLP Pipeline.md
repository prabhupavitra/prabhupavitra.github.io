<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> If there's one form of media which we are exposed to every single day, it's text. There is huge amounts of data created by people and devices, every single day. This data includes and is not limited to comments on social media, product reviews, tweets and reddit messages. Generally speaking, the data from these sources are useful for the purposes of research and commerce. </span>  

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> A NLP pipeline, refers to the series of steps involved in a text-processing pipeline used for any NLP application development. In this article, we will learn about the various steps involved and how they play important roles in solving the NLP problem. </span>  

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> The key stages in the NLP pipeline are as follows.</span>

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> 1. [Data acquisition](#data-acquisition)</span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> 2. [Text cleaning](#text-cleaning)</span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> 3. [Pre-processing](#pre-processing)</span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> 4. [Feature engineering](#feature-engineering)<span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> 5. [Modeling](#modeling)</span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> 6. [Evaluation](#evaluation)</span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> 7. [Deployment](#deployment)</span>   
<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> 8. [Monitoring & Updating Model](#monitoring--updating-model)</span>   

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;">There are a couple of other topics we should keep in mind when understanding linguistics for the purpose of building NLP systems and understanding them certainly helps in understanding how NLP systems work.</span>  


### Data Acquisition

<span style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:16px;"> There are several ways to get data. These include, using Public Datasets, Scrape Data, Product Intervention and Data Augmentation. Data Augmentation can be done by Synonym replacement , Back Translation, TF-IDFâ€“based word replacement, Bigram flipping, Replacing entities and Adding noise to data. Advanced techniques for data augmentation include Snorkel, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) and Active learning. </span>
